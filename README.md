"# robocon" 
This Python script processes video files frame-by-frame to detect red-colored circular objects using OpenCV. 
Based on detection results, frames are saved in categorized folders â€” either as selected (with circles) or notselected (without circles). 
The script works on multiple videos and organizes output neatly for each video.
